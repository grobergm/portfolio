				<p>Welcome to my personal website!</p>
				<p>I am a front-end focused developer, specializing in JavaScript</p>
				<p>I started my career in Ecology, earning a <strong>Master of Science degree</strong> when I was 25.</p>
				<p>After working in various positions, I realized that I had a passion for programming.</p>
				<p>I started teaching myself how to make websites, then went to Epicodus (a six month, full time web development training).</p>
				<p>I live in Eugene, OR, and am looking for a web development position (in Oregon or remote; contract or salary).</p>
